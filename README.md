# Below are some key workflows

## We'd get to explore the relationships between max heart rate and our predictors using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

## We'd get to practice fitting the model using R and interpreting coefficients (you know, "for each additional year of age, the max heart rate decreases by X," etc.).

## We'd have to handle something so-called "complex regressors" since sex and exang are categorical factors.

## It's a perfect setup to test for interactions. For example, we could check if the effect of age on heart rate is different for men versus women.

## We can run through the whole modeling process: 

**do variable selection, use cross-validation to check our prediction error, and (most importantly) check all our model assumptions, like looking for heteroscedasticity.**
